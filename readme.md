# Roomba-Style Obstacle Avoidance Robot 🚀🤖

This project is a simple robotic simulation using Webots that mimics the behavior of a Roomba. The robot is designed to navigate through its environment while avoiding obstacles using infrared distance sensors. This project serves as a learning exercise to understand basic robotic control, sensor integration, and obstacle avoidance algorithms.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The robot is equipped with multiple IR distance sensors (`ps0` to `ps7`) to detect obstacles in its path.
- The robot continuously monitors sensor values to determine proximity to objects.
- If an obstacle is detected in the front, the robot will reverse and turn away to avoid a collision.
- The movement algorithm is simple yet effective, resembling basic Roomba behavior.
